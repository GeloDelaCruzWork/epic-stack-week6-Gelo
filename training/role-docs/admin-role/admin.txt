And also we need to create a workflow for Admin. We have the objectives listed on the updated role narratives, payroll system, revised MD document. We just need to do a workflow and the corresponding UIs for this, as I understand. We have done a simple role-user assignment as part of the admin ui. indeed this is very simple and we can do a more comprehensive UI for Admin   Again, maybe help me out to fill in the gaps of whatever I'm missing to complete this. I'm trying to complete a workflow for each of the roles and UIs associated with it, given the information on the updated narrative roles and whatever I'm adding on these things.
