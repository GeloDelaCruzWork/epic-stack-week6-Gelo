And also we need to create a workflow for the Guards. We have the objectives listed on the updated role narratives, payroll system, revised MD document. We just need to do a workflow and the corresponding UIs for this, as I understand.  We need to compose a UI for the android and for the web app to actualize/implement the Guard objectives in the context of our T&A and Payroll app Again, maybe help me out to fill in the gaps of whatever I'm missing to complete this. I'm trying to complete a workflow for each of the roles and UIs associated with it, given the information on the updated narrative roles and whatever I'm adding on these things.
