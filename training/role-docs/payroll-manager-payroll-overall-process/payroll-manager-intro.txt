 # Comprehensive Payroll Approval Workflow
     ## Executive Overview
     This document defines the complete payroll approval workflow, from initial timesheet submission through final
     disbursement authorization. The workflow incorporates a dual-approval system where the **HR Manager** and
     **Payroll Manager** roles are performed by the same person at different stages, ensuring both detailed
     operational review and executive financial oversight.

  üéØ Key Highlights

  Dual Approval System

  The system implements two critical approval gates managed by the same person:

  1. Gate 1 (HR Manager Hat):
    - Timesheet approval before payroll processing
    - Focus on time accuracy and attendance
    - 24-hour SLA
  2. Gate 2 (Payroll Manager Hat):
    - Final payroll approval after all reviews
    - Focus on total amounts and budget compliance
    - 48-hour SLA

  Why One Person, Two Hats Works

  - Cost-effective for organizations
  - Knowledge continuity from start to finish
  - Faster resolution of issues
  - Consistent standards across the process
  - Industry standard practice

  Change Request Management

  All changes follow a three-tier approval structure:

  Role Interactions

  - Payroll Officer (contracted hours processing)
