What we're going to do next is massive for the payroll officer and in a way for the verifier and the controller where we'll have three major interfaces. How to group them right now is I want you to help me out on this one. We have one UI that may be used by that will be shared or in a way this is the same view as the payroll officer, the verifier, and the controller where we have you know it's like a payslip setup to be mentioned later and the payroll officer will be able to waive deductions. For example, the guard will not be receiving a good pay. It's a pay that could be lower than the floor that we'll be setting later and then we'll have a second UI only for the payroll officer where you know it's a general it's a general thing it's a CRUD reference management for all the payments, payroll related schedule based information. Again, the details will be mentioned on the next information thing. And of course the last to be the light of the payroll officer is where after setting up the major reference payroll related tables like allowances, deductions, government tables, now we'll be assigning guards to these and then we'll be... it's here where we set up, configure, we add schedules and the schedule or view the schedules that have been set up already. And this is just a teaser part, the details will be mentioned in the next narrative, in the following narrative.
