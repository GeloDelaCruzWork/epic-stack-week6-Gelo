# Comprehensive Payroll Approval Workflow

## Executive Overview

This document defines the complete payroll approval workflow, from initial
timesheet submission through final disbursement authorization. The workflow
incorporates a dual-approval system where the **HR Manager** and **Payroll
Manager** roles are performed by the same person at different stages, ensuring
both detailed operational review and executive financial oversight.

### 1.2 Dual Approval Gates

| Gate       | Role            | Stage                    | Focus                                | Authority                          |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Gate 1** | HR Manager      | After Timesheet Creation | Time accuracy, attendance, schedules | Approve/Reject timesheets          |
| **Gate 2** | Payroll Manager | After Financial Review   | Total amounts, budget, compliance    | Approve/Reject/Conditional payroll |

**Note**: Both gates are controlled by the same person wearing different "hats"
at different stages.

## 2. Stage-by-Stage Process

### 2.1 Stage 1: Data Collection

```typescript
interface DataCollectionStage {
	sources: {
		primary: 'Biometric devices at guard posts'
		secondary: 'Manual Excel upload by Operations'
		mobile: 'Android app synchronization'
	}

	validation: {
		duplicateCheck: true
		timeSequenceValidation: true
		locationVerification: true
		deviceAuthentication: true
	}

	output: 'Clock events in system database'
	sla: 'Real-time or within 24 hours for offline sync'
}
```

### 2.2 Stage 2: Timesheet Preparation

```typescript
interface TimesheetPreparation {
	responsible: 'Timekeeper'

	activities: [
		'Process clock events',
		'Create time pairs (IN/OUT)',
		'Calculate hours',
		'Apply schedules',
		'Generate DTR',
		'Create dual timesheets (actual/normalized)',
	]

	validation: {
		scheduleCompliance: true
		overtimeAuthorization: true
		absenceDocumentation: true
	}

	output: 'Complete timesheet ready for approval'
	sla: '24 hours after period end'
}
```

### 2.3 Stage 3: HR Manager Approval (Gate 1)

```typescript
interface HRManagerApproval {
	approver: 'HR/Payroll Manager (wearing HR hat)'

	reviewCriteria: {
		timeAccuracy: 'Verify clock times match reality'
		scheduleAdherence: 'Check against assigned schedules'
		overtimeValidity: 'Confirm overtime authorization'
		absenceJustification: 'Validate leave/absence reasons'
		anomalyDetection: 'Flag unusual patterns'
	}

	actions: {
		approve: {
			individual: 'Review each timesheet'
			batch: 'Bulk approve clean timesheets'
		}
		reject: {
			reason: 'Required specific feedback'
			notification: 'Alert Timekeeper immediately'
			resubmission: 'Track corrections'
		}
	}

	sla: '24 hours from submission'
	escalation: 'Auto-escalate if pending > 24 hours'
}
```

### 2.4 Stage 4: Payroll Processing

```typescript
interface PayrollProcessingChain {
	step1_PayrollOfficer: {
		responsible: 'Payroll Officer'
		tasks: [
			'Apply contract rates',
			'Calculate base pay',
			'Process contracted hours',
			'Handle floor value issues',
			'Defer deductions if needed',
		]
		output: 'Initial paysheet with base calculations'
		sla: '8 hours'
	}

	step2_Verifier: {
		responsible: 'Verifier'
		tasks: [
			'Review non-contracted components',
			'Verify deductions',
			'Check government contributions',
			'Validate allowances',
			'Flag discrepancies',
		]
		output: 'Verified paysheet'
		sla: '4 hours'
	}

	step3_Controller: {
		responsible: 'Controller'
		tasks: [
			'Financial validation',
			'Budget compliance check',
			'Fund availability verification',
			'Cost analysis',
			'Risk assessment',
		]
		output: 'Financially validated paysheet'
		sla: '4 hours'
	}
}
```

### 2.5 Stage 5: Payroll Manager Approval (Gate 2)

```typescript
interface PayrollManagerApproval {
	approver: 'HR/Payroll Manager (wearing Payroll Manager hat)'

	reviewScope: {
		executive: 'High-level financial review'
		comprehensive: 'Leverage knowledge from timesheet stage'
		strategic: 'Consider organizational impact'
	}

	decisionOptions: {
		fullApproval: {
			condition: 'All checks passed'
			action: 'Authorize complete disbursement'
			documentation: 'Digital signature and timestamp'
		}

		partialApproval: {
			condition: 'Minor issues with some payments'
			action: 'Approve subset of payments'
			requirement: 'Document exclusions and reasons'
		}

		conditionalApproval: {
			condition: 'Approval with requirements'
			action: 'Approve pending specific actions'
			tracking: 'Monitor condition compliance'
		}

		rejection: {
			condition: 'Major issues found'
			action: 'Return to appropriate stage'
			options: ['Payroll Officer', 'Verifier', 'Controller', 'Timekeeper']
			requirement: 'Specific correction instructions'
		}
	}

	sla: '48 hours from receipt'
	authority: 'Final and binding for disbursement'
}
```

```

## Conclusion

This comprehensive payroll approval workflow ensures:

1. **Dual Control**: Two approval gates managed by the same person in different
   capacities
2. **Clear Accountability**: Each role has defined responsibilities and
   authority
3. **Efficient Processing**: Defined SLAs and escalation paths
4. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every action documented and traceable
5. **Flexibility**: Multiple approval options (full, partial, conditional)
6. **Risk Management**: Multiple review layers before disbursement
7. **Compliance**: Adherence to regulatory requirements
8. **Transparency**: Clear visibility throughout the process

The workflow balances control with efficiency, ensuring accurate and timely
payroll processing while maintaining appropriate oversight and compliance.
