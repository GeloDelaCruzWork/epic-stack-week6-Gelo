Now, the workflow for the timekeeper would be something... What we had for the timesheet page would be a basis for the timekeeper function. We should put a wrapper around it where it's just like the payroll view. This time it's just a timesheet view where initially we would select the pay period. And then on the left pane, it's a selection of the same as the payroll thing. It's a list of locations drilled down. Eventually, we would choose the guard. Or, straight away, a list of the guards. So we could be focusing on eventually the right pane, the main panel, where there would be a list of initially the timesheets associated with the guard for the pay period. And then we could drill down and make corresponding updates, the right kind of updates. On top, it's a selection of the pay period. And then a selection of either... There's another dropdown where we could display a location-based or straight away a guard-based so that the corresponding left panel would be configured. And then just repeating the main panel would just be a list of the timesheets as they are being finalized on a daily basis. This could be dynamically created based on what's happening. So basically, it's good. The timekeeper would have this interface just like the one that we made for the payroll officer, controller, and the verifier. Fish guard. And then there's a view. It's not a basic view. This time, it's straight away a timesheet view where we could make changes to the time logs. I think right now it's just changes to the time logs. And we do not touch the clock events as these are our source of truth. And the time logs are a way of having the correct inputs to the DTRs. We don't touch the DTRs and the timesheets for now. And whatever changes we have for the time logs, this would be an audit. It would follow our request verification and approval that would be added to the approval or rejection dashboard of the HR manager. That's what we have now.
