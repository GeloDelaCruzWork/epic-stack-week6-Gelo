  Critical Design Decisions:

  1. Clock Events are Immutable - They serve as the source of truth and cannot be edited

  3. No Cost Visibility - Timekeeper sees only hours, not amounts (per requirements)
  4. Dual Time Tracking - Actual hours for payroll, normalized for billing

  Integration Points:

  - From OPS: Manual entries, schedule info, initial adjustments
  - To HR Manager: Completed timesheets for approval
  - To Payroll Officer: Approved hours (after HR Manager approval)
  - Audit System: Complete trail of all changes

  User Interface Highlights:

  1. Main Dashboard - Overview of processing pipeline status
  2. Sync Monitor - Real-time view of clock event sources
  3. Timelog Grid - Editable interface with adjustment capabilities
  4. DTR Review - Generated records with attendance summary
  5. Timesheet Submission - Batch processing to HR Manager
  6. Leave Integration - Apply approved leaves to timelogs
  7. Audit Trail - Complete change history with approval chain

  The system ensures accurate time accounting while maintaining the integrity of source data and providing a clear, auditable        
  path from clock events to approved timesheets.
