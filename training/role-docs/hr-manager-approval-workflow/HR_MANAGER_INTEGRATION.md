# HR Manager Integration Document

## Executive Summary

This document comprehensively integrates the **HR Manager** role into the
timesheet approval and coverage validation system. The HR Manager serves as the
**first approval gate** for all timesheets, ensuring complete coverage of guard
posts and accurate time aggregation before payroll processing begins. The HR
Manager works closely with Operations (for coverage) and the Timekeeper (for
time accuracy), focusing exclusively on operational aspects rather than
financial considerations.

**Critical Note**: The HR Manager and Payroll Manager roles are performed by the
**same person** at different stages of the process. This document focuses on the
HR Manager responsibilities during the timesheet approval stage.

## 1. Role Definition and Core Responsibilities

### 1.1 HR Manager Overview

The HR Manager is the **operational-level approval authority** for timesheets
and coverage validation. This role represents the first quality checkpoint
ensuring that:

- All guard posts maintain continuous coverage
- Clock events from all sources are consolidated correctly
- Time aggregations (regular, overtime, night differential) are accurate
- Operational compliance is maintained

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Coverage Guardian**: Ensures no post is left unmanned
- **Time Accuracy Validator**: Confirms clock events are complete and paired
- **Operations Liaison**: Works directly with Ops for gap resolution
- **Timekeeper Collaborator**: Partners for accurate time processing
- **Non-Financial Focus**: No involvement in rates, pay, or costs

### 1.2 Primary Responsibilities

#### Coverage Management:

- Validate all ships and detachments have guards deployed
- Identify coverage gaps in real-time
- Coordinate with Operations for immediate gap filling
- Ensure handover overlaps between shifts
- Monitor critical posts for continuous manning

#### Time Event Validation:

- Review consolidated clock events from all sources
- Ensure complete IN/OUT pairs for all guards
- Validate time aggregations (regular, OT, ND, holiday)
- Identify and flag anomalies or patterns
- Approve or reject timesheets based on completeness

#### Collaboration:

- Real-time communication with Operations Manager
- Direct feedback loop with Timekeeper
- Coordination with HR Officer for leave/schedule impacts
- Escalation to Payroll Manager (same person, different hat) when needed

### 1.3 What HR Manager Does NOT Handle

To maintain clear role boundaries, the HR Manager explicitly does NOT:

- Calculate or review payment amounts
- Process deductions or allowances
- Make financial decisions
- Approve payroll disbursements (Payroll Manager role)
- Handle rate negotiations or changes

## 10. Conclusion

The HR Manager integration completes the first critical gate in the timesheet
and payroll process. Key aspects of this integration include:

1. **Coverage Focus**: Primary responsibility for ensuring no post is unmanned
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous validation of guard deployment
3. **Rapid Response**: Immediate action on coverage gaps
4. **Strong Partnerships**: Close collaboration with Operations and Timekeeper
5. **Clear Boundaries**: No involvement in financial matters
6. **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring accurate data enters payroll system
7. **Efficient Processing**: Streamlined approval workflows
8. **Complete Documentation**: Full audit trail of all decisions

The HR Manager serves as the guardian of operational coverage, working closely
with Operations to ensure continuous protection across all ships, detachments,
and special posts while validating time accuracy with the Timekeeper. This role
is essential for maintaining security service quality and ensuring accurate
timesheet data for payroll processing.

The dual-role approach (same person as Payroll Manager) provides continuity and
comprehensive oversight across the entire payroll process, from initial
timesheet validation to final payment authorization.
