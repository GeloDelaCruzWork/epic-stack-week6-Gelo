  Key Features of the HR Manager Role:

  - Primary Focus: Ensuring complete coverage of all guard posts (ships, detachments, special posts)
  - Main Objective: Validating that Operations has provided adequate coverage and clock events are complete
  - Key Partners: Works closely with Operations Manager and Timekeeper
  - No Financial Involvement: Purely operational focus on coverage and time accuracy
  - First Gate: Approves timesheets before they enter payroll processing
  - Same Person as Payroll Manager: Provides oversight at both ends of the process

  The documentation emphasizes the HR Manager's critical role in ensuring no security gaps exist and that all time data is accurate      
  before it proceeds to payroll processing. This creates a robust two-gate system where the same person validates operational
  coverage (as HR Manager) and later approves financial aspects (as Payroll Manager).
