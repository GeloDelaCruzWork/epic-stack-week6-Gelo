# OPS (Operations) Module Documentation

## Overview

The OPS module provides comprehensive operations management for tracking
operational activities, incidents, tasks, and resources. It follows a
hierarchical structure similar to the timesheet system but focused on
operational workflows.

## Hierarchical Structure

```
Operation (Main Operational Activity)
  └── Incident (Operational Events/Issues)
      └── Task (Specific Actions/Assignments)
          └── Resource (Personnel/Equipment/Materials)
```

## Workflow Diagrams

### 1. OPS Module Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "OPS Module"
        OP[Operations]
        INC[Incidents]
        TSK[Tasks]
        RES[Resources]
    end

    subgraph "Database Layer"
        DB[(PostgreSQL)]
        CACHE[In-Memory Cache]
    end

    subgraph "API Layer"
        API[REST API]
        AUTH[Authentication]
        PERM[Permissions]
    end

    subgraph "UI Layer"
        GRID[AG-Grid Enterprise]
        DIALOG[Edit Dialogs]
        FORMS[Form Components]
    end

    OP --> INC
    INC --> TSK
    TSK --> RES

    API --> DB
    API --> CACHE
    AUTH --> PERM

    GRID --> API
    DIALOG --> API
    FORMS --> API
```

### 2. Operation Lifecycle

```mermaid

    [*] --> Draft: Create Operation
    Draft --> Planning: Submit for Planning
    Planning --> InProgress: Approve & Start
    Planning --> Draft: Reject
    InProgress --> OnHold: Pause
    OnHold --> InProgress: Resume
    InProgress --> Completed: Complete
    InProgress --> Cancelled: Cancel
    Completed --> Archived: Archive
    Cancelled --> Archived: Archive
    Archived --> [*]
```

### 3. Incident Management Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Incident Reported] --> B{Severity Level}
    B -->|Critical| C[Immediate Response]
    B -->|High| D[Priority Queue]
    B -->|Medium| E[Standard Queue]
    B -->|Low| F[Backlog]

    C --> G[Assign Team]
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G

    G --> H[Create Tasks]
    H --> I[Allocate Resources]
    I --> J[Execute Tasks]
    J --> K{Resolution}
    K -->|Resolved| L[Close Incident]
    K -->|Escalate| M[Reassign]
    M --> G
    L --> N[Post-Incident Review]
    N --> O[Archive]
```

### 4. Task Assignment Workflow

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant S as System
    participant DB as Database
    participant N as Notification

    U->>S: Create Task
    S->>DB: Save Task (Status: Unassigned)
    S->>S: Check Available Resources
    S->>U: Show Resource Options
    U->>S: Select Resources
    S->>DB: Update Task Assignment
    S->>N: Send Assignment Notification
    N->>U: Notify Assigned Personnel
    U->>S: Accept/Decline Assignment
    alt Assignment Accepted
        S->>DB: Update Status (In Progress)
        S->>U: Show Task Dashboard
    else Assignment Declined
        S->>DB: Update Status (Unassigned)
        S->>S: Find Alternative Resource
    end
```

### 5. Resource Allocation Matrix

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Resource Types"
        P[Personnel]
        E[Equipment]
        M[Materials]
        V[Vehicles]
    end

    subgraph "Allocation States"
        AV[Available]
        AS[Assigned]
        MB[Maintenance/Break]
        UN[Unavailable]
    end

    subgraph "Task Requirements"
        TR[Task Requirements]
        SK[Skill Match]
        TM[Time Slot]
        LC[Location]
    end

    P --> AV
    E --> AV
    M --> AV
    V --> AV

    AV --> AS
    AS --> MB
    MB --> AV
    AS --> UN

    TR --> SK
    SK --> AS
    TM --> AS
    LC --> AS
```
