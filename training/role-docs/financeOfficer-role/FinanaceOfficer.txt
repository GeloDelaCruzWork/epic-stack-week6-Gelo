And also we need to create a workflow for the Finance Officer. We have the objectives listed on the updated role narratives,       
  payroll system, revised MD document. We just need to do a workflow and the corresponding UIs for this, as I understand.    Again,  
   maybe help me out to fill in the gaps of whatever I'm missing to complete this. I'm trying to complete a workflow for each of     
  the roles and UIs associated with it, given the information on the updated narrative roles and whatever I'm adding on these        
  things. add this as reference 'Updated Role Narratives - Payroll System (Revised).md'
