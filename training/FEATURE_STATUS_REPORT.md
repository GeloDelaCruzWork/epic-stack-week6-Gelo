## üéØ PRIORITY ACTIONS

### High Priority (Blocking Features)

1. **Fix Email Sending**
   - Affects: Password reset, email verification, email change
   - Estimated effort: 4-8 hours
   - Assigned to: Developer 1

2. **Enable GitHub OAuth**
   - Affects: Social login, user onboarding
   - Estimated effort: 6-10 hours
   - Assigned to: Developer 2

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Security)

3. **Complete Passkeys**
   - Affects: Passwordless authentication
   - Estimated effort: 10-16 hours
   - Assigned to: Developer 3

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

- Add more OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft)
- Implement login history
- Add device management
- Email notifications for security events

---

## üìù NOTES FOR TEAM

### What's Working Well

- Core authentication is solid
- Database structure is clean
- Test infrastructure is good
- TypeScript is properly configured

### Known Issues

1. Email templates might need creation/updates
2. OAuth redirect URLs need production values
3. Passkeys need browser compatibility testing

### Development Environment

- PostgreSQL required (not SQLite)
- Node.js with Argon2 support
- Environment variables properly configured

### Testing Credentials

```
Username: kody
Password: kodylovesyou
```
