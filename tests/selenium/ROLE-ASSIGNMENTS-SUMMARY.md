## 🎨 Mock Interface Features

The mock successfully demonstrates:

1. **Three Role Cards**:
   - Admin (Full Access) - Red badge
   - User (Standard Access) - Blue badge
   - Guest (Limited Access) - Gray badge

2. **User Management**:
   - 4 users with avatars (initials)
   - Name and email display
   - Draggable user cards

3. **Permissions Display**:
   - Color-coded permission badges
   - CRUD permissions
   - Admin access indicator

4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Smooth drag and drop
   - Toast notifications
   - Button interactions
   - Alert dialogs

## 🔐 Current Limitation

**Admin Access Required**: The `/admin/role-assignments` route requires admin
privileges that the test user "kody" doesn't have.

### Solutions:

1. **Use Admin User**:

   ```javascript
   // Login with admin credentials
   await login('admin', 'adminpassword')
   ```

2. **Grant Admin Role to Kody**:

   ```sql
   -- In database
   UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE username = 'kody';
   ```

3. **Test Environment Variable**:
   ```javascript
   // Add test bypass
   if (process.env.E2E_TEST === 'true') {
   	// Allow test access
   }
   ```
