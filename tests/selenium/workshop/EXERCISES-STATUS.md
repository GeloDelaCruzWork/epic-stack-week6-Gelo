## 📝 Exercise Highlights

### Exercise 5: Network Mocking ✨

- Successfully intercepts fetch calls
- Demonstrates XHR mocking
- Shows localStorage manipulation
- WebSocket mocking concepts

**Output:**

- Intercepted 2 fetch calls during search
- Mocked XHR responses working
- localStorage data successfully injected

### Exercise 6: Page Object Model ✨

- Complete LoginPage implementation
- Method chaining support
- Field validation checks
- OAuth button detection

**Components:**

- `pages/LoginPage.cjs` - Full login page object
- `pages/NotesPage.cjs` - Notes functionality page object

### Exercise 8: Test Organization ✨

- Mocha-style structure without requiring Mocha
- Test suite organization with describe/it pattern
- Results tracking and reporting
- Parallel test execution demonstration

**Results:**

- 8 tests total
- 7 passed, 1 failed (expected - testing invalid credentials)
- Demonstrates proper test organization

### Exercise 9: Final Challenge ✨

- Complete Notes test suite
- CRUD operations testing
- Search functionality
- Error handling
- Performance metrics
- Visual regression
