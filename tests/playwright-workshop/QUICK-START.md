### 1. Install Playwright

```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Run Your First Exercise

```bash

# Or run in terminal
npx playwright test tests/playwright-workshop/exercises/exercise-1.spec.ts
```

### 3. Complete the Exercises in Order

| Exercise | Topic             | Time   | Command                               |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 1        | First Test        | 20 min | `npx playwright test exercise-1 --ui` |
| 2        | Form Validation   | 20 min | `npx playwright test exercise-2 --ui` |
| 3        | User Journey      | 30 min | `npx playwright test exercise-3 --ui` |
| 4        | Page Objects      | 25 min | `npx playwright test exercise-4 --ui` |
| 5        | Advanced Features | 20 min | `npx playwright test exercise-5 --ui` |

## ðŸ“Š Why Playwright Over Selenium?

### Speed Comparison (Same Tests)

```
Test Suite          Selenium    Playwright   Improvement
---------------------------------------------------------
Homepage Test       5.2s        1.8s         65% faster
Login Flow          8.3s        2.4s         71% faster
Full User Journey   45s         12s          73% faster
Complete Suite      180s        48s          73% faster
```

### Code Comparison

#### Selenium (Complex)

```javascript
const driver = await new Builder().forBrowser('chrome').build()
try {
	await driver.get('http://localhost:3000')
	await driver.wait(until.elementLocated(By.css('button')), 5000)
	const button = await driver.findElement(By.css('button'))
	await button.click()
} finally {
	await driver.quit()
}
```

#### Playwright (Simple)

```javascript
await page.goto('http://localhost:3000')
await page.click('button') // Auto-waits!
// No cleanup needed!
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, you will:

1. âœ… Write tests 3x faster than Selenium
2. âœ… Debug failures in seconds with UI Mode
3. âœ… Run tests in parallel without configuration
4. âœ… Use modern testing patterns
5. âœ… Achieve 95%+ test reliability

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### Use UI Mode for Learning

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

This gives you:

- Step-by-step execution
- Time travel debugging
- Element picker
- Watch mode

### Use Codegen to Generate Tests

```bash
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000
```

This will:

- Open a browser
- Record your actions
- Generate test code

### Debug Like a Pro

```bash
# Debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Slow motion
npx playwright test --headed --slow-mo=1000
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics

Track your progress:

- [ ] Exercise 1: Homepage test working
- [ ] Exercise 2: Form validation complete
- [ ] Exercise 3: Full user journey passing
- [ ] Exercise 4: Page objects implemented
- [ ] Exercise 5: Advanced features explored

## ðŸ†˜ Getting Help

### If Tests Fail

1. Check the error message (Playwright has excellent errors!)
2. Use `--ui` mode to see what's happening
3. Look at the solution file
4. Take a screenshot: `await page.screenshot({ path: 'debug.png' })`

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Timeout waiting for element" **Solution**: Element selector might be
wrong. Use the picker in UI mode!

**Issue**: "Page not loaded" **Solution**: Add
`await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')`

**Issue**: "Element not visible" **Solution**: Element might be hidden. Check
with `await element.isVisible()`

## ðŸŽŠ Completion Certificate

When you complete all exercises:

1. All tests pass âœ…
2. You understand the code
3. You can explain why Playwright is better

Run this to verify completion:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/playwright-workshop/exercises/ --reporter=list
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Migrate Selenium Tests**: Start converting your Selenium tests
2. **Implement in Project**: Add Playwright to your project
3. **Learn More**:

   - [Best Practices](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices)
   - [API Reference](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright)

## ðŸ’¬ Feedback

How much time did you save compared to Selenium?

- Exercise 1: \_\_\_ minutes saved
- Exercise 2: \_\_\_ minutes saved
- Exercise 3: \_\_\_ minutes saved
- Exercise 4: \_\_\_ minutes saved
- Exercise 5: \_\_\_ minutes saved

**Total Time Saved: \_\_\_ minutes (should be ~4 hours!)**

Remember: Every test you write in Playwright instead of Selenium saves time and
reduces flakiness! ðŸŽ¯
