## üìä Playwright vs Selenium Comparison

| Feature            | Playwright         | Selenium            |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Setup Time         | 5 minutes          | 30 minutes          |
| Auto-waiting       | ‚úÖ Built-in        | ‚ùå Manual           |
| Parallel Execution | ‚úÖ Default         | ‚ùå Complex setup    |
| Debugging          | ‚úÖ UI Mode, Traces | ‚ö†Ô∏è Screenshots only |
| Speed              | ‚ö° 2-4x faster     | üê¢ Baseline         |
| Reliability        | üíö 95%+            | üü® 70-80%           |

## Setup Instructions

### Install Playwright (One Command!)

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
# Or for existing project:
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

That's it! No driver management, no complex configuration.

- UI Mode with time-travel debugging
- Trace viewer
- Step-by-step execution
- DOM snapshots at each step

---

## Exercise 5: Network Mocking (20 minutes vs Selenium's 45 minutes)

### Task

Mock API responses for testing

### Why Playwright is Better Here

- Built-in network interception
- No external tools needed
- Route handlers
- Response modification

---

## Exercise 6: Advanced Page Object Model (30 minutes vs Selenium's 60 minutes)

### Task

Implement advanced Page Object Model with fixtures and inheritance

### Why Playwright is Better Here

- Native fixture support for dependency injection
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Automatic setup/teardown
- No PageFactory complexity
- Better composition patterns

---

## Exercise 7: Visual Testing (25 minutes vs Selenium's 120 minutes!)

### Task

Implement comprehensive visual regression testing

### Why Playwright is Better Here

- Built-in visual testing (FREE vs $599+/month for tools)
- Automatic baseline management
- Cross-browser screenshots
- PDF generation
- Element masking for dynamic content

---

## Exercise 8: Test Organization (30 minutes vs Selenium's 60 minutes)

### Task

Master test organization, data-driven testing, and parallel execution

### Why Playwright is Better Here

- Native parallel execution (no Grid needed)
- Built-in test tagging and filtering
- Custom fixtures and test data factories
- Environment-specific configurations
- Serial/parallel test control

---

## Exercise 9: Final Challenge (45 minutes vs Selenium's 180 minutes!)

### Task

Build a complete E2E test suite with everything you've learned

### Why Playwright is Better Here

- Comprehensive page objects
